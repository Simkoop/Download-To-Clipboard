## About The Project

This project is just a small time save. I was using an online code screenshotter, but every time I downloaded the screenshot I had to go and drag and drop it in from my downloads. This program solves that niche scenario, by selecting the browser to open the download with this program.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Getting started is incredibly easy. Download the file, and put it in a safe directory.

It is possible to use on chrome, but I sugested you use firefox.

For firefox simply download an image, and on the screen where it asks you what program to open the file with browse to DownloadToClip.exe and done.

For chrome you have to change your default image opener to the DownloadToClip.exe and then after downloading an image you can click on it and it should work. For chrome make sure you change the default image opener back when you are done, I might make a tool for that if there is interest.
